# DragRaceCastREACT

In this project I used React at that I learned from the Breakingbad API. I wanted to see if I could replicate my project. In this project I also created a small app to show and filter the character info.

The API had different card back information.
I was able to succefully add quotes, the season they were in and the place they took in thier season.

I am currently having trouble applying the search bar. HTTPS vs HTTP error.
